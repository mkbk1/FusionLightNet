# FusionLightNet: A Robust Framework for Multi-Scale Traffic Signal Detection with AI-Generated Data

## Introduction

FusionLightNet is an advanced framework designed to robustly detect traffic signals across multiple scales. Leveraging the power of AI-generated data, this model enhances the accuracy and reliability of traffic signal detection in diverse environmental conditions.

## Features

- **Multi-Scale Detection**: Capable of identifying traffic signals of varying sizes and orientations.
- **AI-Generated Data**: Utilizes synthetic data created through AI to improve model training and performance.
- **Robust Performance**: Tested under various lighting and weather conditions to ensure reliable signal detection.

## Installation

To set up the FusionLightNet framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/RDXiaoLu/FusionLightNet.git  
   cd FusionLightNet

   Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the model, execute the following command:

bash
python main.py --config config/config.yaml
Make sure to adjust the configuration file as needed for your dataset and environment.

Dataset
FusionLightNet utilizes a combination of real and synthetic datasets for training. Instructions for generating and preparing the dataset can be found in the data directory.
